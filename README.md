# svgbuilder

Create inceractive SVG models for lasercutting.

Similar to OpenSCAD's customizer, but more flexible on the UI side (I think).

# How to use

Umm, currently -- adapt the index.html. Good luck.
(This is supposed to improve in the future)

See the code for a catapult example.

# Contributing

All help is welcome. :)

Particularly if it makes the thing easier to use as a library/module.
